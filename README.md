# Pollen Panic (Pacman-Java)

A modern, feature-rich Pacman-inspired game with a butterfly and bee theme, written in Java using Swing.

> **Theme:**
> - The main character is a butterfly (replacing Pacman).
> - The enemies are bees (replacing ghosts).
> - The pellets are pollen, and the powerups are flowers.
> - The maze walls are designed to look like honeycomb blocks.
> - All models and sprites (butterfly, bees, pollen, flowers, leaves walls) are custom-made by Jossanah Ellaine Peji.

> **This project was created by a group of 5 students from section BSCS 1-2 (A.Y. 2024-2025) to fulfill our final requirement in Computer Programming II (DCIT23), under Ms. Lourielene Baldomero.**

   - Download the latest LTS version (Java 17 or Java 21 recommended) for your operating system.
   - Run the installer and follow the instructions.
2. **Verify Installation**
   - Open a terminal (Command Prompt, PowerShell, or Terminal) and run:
     ```sh
     java -version
     javac -version
     ```
   - You should see version information for both commands. If not, add Java to your system PATH.
